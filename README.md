This repo is set up for **accurate performance profiling** of small blocks of code.

Functionally, itâ€™s pretty straightforward â€” but as anyone whoâ€™s tried knows, **profiling correctly is deceptively hard**.

## ðŸ”Ž Key Files

- `*_tests/utils/profile.go` â€“ minimal profiler loop
- `*_tests/utils/suite.go` â€“ suite runner to manage testing in isolated executables
- `*_tests/suites/<test_name>/<implementation_name>` - where your code to be profiled should live, check the example of `two_sum`

You can plug your own logic into the test suites and generate comparative timings across multiple configurations. All the hard stuff (timing, iteration control, test isolation) is handled for you.

See the [blog post](https://mrshiny608.github.io/MrShiny608/optimisation/2025/04/15/ProfilingCodeWithoutGettingTricked) for an in-depth look at the _why_ behind this setup â€” including all the subtle ways benchmarking can lie to you, and how to get reliable, reproducible results instead.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install Python & Dependencies

Ensure PIP is installed and in your `PATH`:

```bash
pip --version
```

Install [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/):

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pipenv install
```

### 2. Install Go

Ensure [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) is installed and in your `PATH`:

```bash
go version
```

Then install any module dependencies (from the root of the Go test suite):

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Run a Test

From the root directory:

```bash
bash run.sh <test_name> -p   # Run Python test
bash run.sh <test_name> -g   # Run Go test
```

Replace `<test_name>` with the name of your test config.

### 4. Observe

Tests will always run first, there's no point profiling broken code, then profiling information will be output as it runs.

If you intend to leave the tests running for a long time on a remote machine, you can use `nohup` to prevent terminal hangup, this will by default direct all output to `nohup.out`.

```bash
nohup bash run.sh <test_name> -p -g &
```
